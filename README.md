This was a very fun project. Took me some time so i know i have to work on my ace when coding but apart from that i feel really confident about my coding journey.

I started using Frontend mentor because i recently just learnt HTML and CSS and i wanted to start learning JS but decided to practice what i learnt before going. 

I'll still make some more projects before heading over to JS tho.
